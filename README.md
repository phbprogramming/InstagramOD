# InstagramOD
Automating those boring Instagram grinds.

Most Instagram Bots employ a scatter shot tactic for their autofollows and likes. With only a limited number of rate-limited actions per day, it is important to try and maximize the effectiveness rate of your follows by increasing probability of **CTR** (click through rate) from an adveretising perspective.

## Setup
 * Python dependencies are in requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 * In *credentials.py*, you need to add your instagram login and MongoDB connection URL
 * Get a free mongo cloud server [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/cloud)
 * See instructions in *load_scrapers.py* to add scraping bots to your botnet

## Run
After you have finished simply run `python load_scrapers.py`
